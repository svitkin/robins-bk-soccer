lead: "Brooklyn Soccer after the Great War"

By the end of the 1920/21 season, Robins Dry Dock F.C. had spent an embittered fourteen and a half hours sharing the field with their rivals Erie A.A. - from nearby soccer hotbed Kearny, NJ. Four of those games comprised a round of the American Cup, and according to newspapers of that era, was the longest soccer cup round played in the history of the United States. Two of those games were in the more prestigious National Challenge Cup (now known as the U.S. Open Cup). They prevailed in both on their way to a domestic cup double, the first team from Brooklyn to accomplish this feat - a marker of success recognized across the diverse, often embattled, world of early soccer in the United States. 

A season later they ceased to exist.

Just a couple of decades earlier, in the north of England, a "works" team originating from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway company, was struggling to raise funds. Robins Dry Dock F.C. was also a "works" team, founded and funded by the ship building and repair company Todd Shipyards. Unlike Robins, this team managed to get through its troubles and scrape by with the aid of a few local businessmen. Shortly after the influx of new investment, it changed its name from Newton Heath LYR Football Club to the more recognizable Manchester United.

Where did it go right and where did it go wrong for Robins? There's no easy answer to the rise and fall of a great team, or really the rise and fall of all of soccer in the U.S.A. during those early, optimistic years, when it seemed like the sport was constantly on the precipice of breaking through. Soccer was experiencing those familiar tensions in this country - between an influx in immigration and American isolationism, between win-now greed and grassroots investment, between the urge to go national and the real cultural and practical difficulties in travel across such a big country. Somewhere in the midst of all of that, a team in Red Hook gave a few great years to those early supporters of the sport.
