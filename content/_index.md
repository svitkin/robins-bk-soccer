lead: "Brooklyn Soccer after the Great War"

By the end of the 1920/21 season, Robins Dry Dock F.C. had spent an embittered fourteen and a half hours sharing the field with their rivals Erie A.A. - from nearby soccer hotbed Kearny, NJ. Four of those games comprised a round of the American Cup, and according to newspapers of that era, was the longest soccer cup round played in the history of the United States. Two of those games were in the more prestigious National Challengers Cup (now known as the U.S. Open Cup). They prevailed in both on their way to a domestic cup double, the first team from Brooklyn to accomplish this feat - a marker of success recognized across the diverse, often embattled, world of early soccer in the United States. 

A season later they ceased to exist.
