By the end of the 1920/21 season, Robins Dry Dock F.C. had spent an embittered fourteen and a half hours sharing the field with their rivals Erie A.A. - from nearby soccer hotbed Kearny, NJ. Four of those games comprised a round of the American Cup, and according to newspapers of that era, was the longest soccer cup round played in the history of the United States. Two of those games were in the more prestigious National Challenge Cup (now known as the U.S. Open Cup). They prevailed in both on their way to a domestic cup double, the first team from Brooklyn to accomplish this feat - a marker of success recognized across the diverse, often embattled, world of early soccer in the United States. 

A season later they ceased to exist.

Just a couple of decades earlier, in the north of England, a "works" team originating from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway company, was struggling to raise funds. Robins Dry Dock F.C. was also a "works" team, founded and funded by the ship building and repair company Todd Shipyards. Unlike Robins, this team managed to get through its troubles and scrape by with the aid of a few local businessmen. Shortly after the influx of new investment, it changed its name from Newton Heath LYR Football Club to the more recognizable Manchester United.

Where did it go right and where did it go wrong for Robins? There's no easy answer to the rise and fall of a great team, or really the rise and fall of all of soccer in the U.S.A. during those early, optimistic years, when it seemed like the sport was constantly on the precipice of breaking through. Soccer was experiencing those familiar tensions in this country - between an influx in immigration and American isolationism, between win-now greed and grassroots investment, between the urge to go national and the real cultural and practical difficulties in travel across such a big country. Somewhere in the midst of all of that, a team in Red Hook gave a few great years to those early supporters of the sport.


# Hyphenated-Americans

> There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated Americans, I do not refer to naturalized Americans. Some of the very best Americans I have ever known were naturalized Americans, Americans born abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all. This is just as true of the man who puts “native” before the hyphen as of the man who puts German or Irish or English or French before the hyphen. Americanism is a matter of the spirit and of the soul. Our allegiance must be purely to the United States. We must unsparingly condemn any man who holds any other allegiance. But if he is heartily and singly loyal to this Republic, then no matter where he was born, he is just as good an American as anyone else.

President Theodore Roosevelt | October 12, 1915


It's the early 20th century in the northeastern United States, and industry is taking over. Textile mills, shipbuilding yards, factories all spring up and take root in towns and cities. They bring jobs and with those jobs, immigrants looking for jobs.

John R. Drysdale is one of those immigrants, arriving from Scotland in 1899 and quickly settling in and marrying Maud, born in New Jersey to her own set of Scottish immigrant parents. They move together to Brooklyn, John having got a job as a coppersmith at the dry dock (a type of basin that can be flooded to allow vessels in, and then dried to allow them to be worked on) in South Brooklyn, at the end of Ostego street. 

John, along with countless other immigrants, would bring their love of soccer with them.

Scottish-Americans had been coming over in droves to the northeast and they did not just bring their affinity for their sport, but also their style. Soccer, having formed as the brother of rugby from an older ball-playing sport, did not have passing embedded into the game from the outset. In the mid 1800's, it would be not uncommon for a player to just dribble the ball, with little to no regard to their teammates, and then shoot. Then the other team would do the same. It took a revolution in style in Scotland, in particular from Queen's Park in Glasgow, to bring passing combinations to the fore and change the game. That short passing style quickly became the obvious path forward for the game, and in the U.S., became the style most associated with how "hyphenated-Americans" played the sport.
