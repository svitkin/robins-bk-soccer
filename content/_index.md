By the end of the 1920/21 season, Robins Dry Dock F.C. had spent an embittered fourteen hours sharing the field with their rivals Erie A.A. - from nearby soccer hotbed Kearny, NJ. Four of those games comprised a round of the American Cup, and according to newspapers of that era, was the longest soccer cup round played in the history of the United States. Two of those games were in the more prestigious National Challenge Cup (now known as the U.S. Open Cup). They prevailed in both on their way to a domestic cup double, the first team from Brooklyn to accomplish this feat - a marker of dominance recognized across the diverse, often embattled, world of early soccer in the United States. 

A season later they ceased to exist.

Robins Dry Dock F.C. was a "works" team, founded and funded by the ship building and repair company Todd Shipyards, and its players were all employees of the company. Just a couple of decades earlier, in the north of England, another "works" team originating from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway company, was struggling to raise funds. Unlike Robins, this team managed to get through its troubles and scrape by with the aid of a few local businessmen. Shortly after the influx of new investment, it changed its name from Newton Heath LYR Football Club to the more recognizable Manchester United.

Where did it go right and where did it go wrong for Robins? There's no easy answer to the rise and fall of a great team, or really the rise and fall of all of soccer in the U.S.A. during those early, optimistic years, when it seemed like the sport was constantly on the precipice of breaking through. Soccer was experiencing those familiar tensions in this country - between an influx in immigration and American isolationism, between win-now greed and grassroots investment, between the urge to go national and the real cultural and practical difficulties in travel across such a big country. Somewhere in the midst of all of that, a team in Red Hook gave a few great years to those early supporters of the sport.


# Hyphenated-Americans

> There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated Americans, I do not refer to naturalized Americans. Some of the very best Americans I have ever known were naturalized Americans, Americans born abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all. This is just as true of the man who puts “native” before the hyphen as of the man who puts German or Irish or English or French before the hyphen. Americanism is a matter of the spirit and of the soul. Our allegiance must be purely to the United States. We must unsparingly condemn any man who holds any other allegiance. But if he is heartily and singly loyal to this Republic, then no matter where he was born, he is just as good an American as anyone else.

President Theodore Roosevelt | October 12, 1915


It's the early 20th century in the northeastern United States, and industry is taking over. Textile mills, shipbuilding yards, factories all spring up and take root in towns and cities. They bring jobs and with those jobs, immigrants looking for jobs.

John R. Drysdale is one of those immigrants, arriving from Scotland in 1899 and quickly settling in and marrying Maud, born in New Jersey to her own set of Scottish immigrant parents. They move together to Brooklyn, John having got a job as a coppersmith at the dry dock (a type of basin that can be flooded to allow vessels in, and then dried to allow them to be worked on) in South Brooklyn, at the end of Ostego street. Years later, he would become a coach of this company's soccer team.

John, along with countless other immigrants, would bring their love of soccer with them.

Scottish-Americans had been coming over in droves to the northeast and they did not just bring their affinity for the game, but also their style. Soccer, having formed as the brother of rugby from an older ball-playing sport, did not have passing embedded into it from the outset. In the mid 1800's, it would not be uncommon for a player to just dribble the ball, with little to no regard to their teammates, and then shoot. Then the other team would do the same. It took a revolution in style in Scotland, in particular from Queen's Park in Glasgow, to bring passing combinations to the fore and change how the game was played. That short passing style quickly became the obvious path forward, and in the U.S., became the style most associated with how "hyphenated-Americans" played the sport.

In the first part of the twentieth century many of these "hyphenated-Americans" settled in what would become early hotbeds of soccer activity of the Northeast. The textile mill hubs of Fall River, MA and Kearny, NJ attracted new workers. New York City, of course, had always been a center for immigration. 

When Robins Dry Dock FC formed in 1918, the world of NYC soccer was already full of teams representing the country or ethnic homeland they had emigrated from. For six years running (and many years after), the New York Footballers' Protective Association, an organization that helped provide funds for injured players, held a popular fundraising tournament where players would join teams of their nationality (like Sweden, Scotland, England) and play against each other. In the local leagues, team names like Hungarian-American FC or Clan MacDuff were not uncommon. 

In an early round of the National Challenge Cup in 1918, Robins played the New York Students' Chinese Soccer Club, billed as the first Chinese-American soccer team in the U.S. Founded by Kwang Lim Kwong, a student at Columbia University, the team was good enough to compete in the major competitions of the day, although they lost to Robins Dry Dock 6 - 0, and mentions of them in the 1920s faded.

The Robins themselves would be frequently referred to as a team of immigrants, with most of their players being of English or Scottish descent. Their manager - John R. Drysdale - was no different.

Their time together would be bookended by Theodore Roosevelt's Hyphenated-Americans speech and the 1924 Immigration Act, which imposed quotas on immigrants from certain countries. Wider, negative trends towards immigrants would be reflected in the discourse about what soccer should be and who it should be played by, with the Robins central to that conversation.


# A War Work Team

In 1918, the Great War was coming to a close. The U.S.'s involvement had caused many thousands of sportsmen to be drafted or enlist. With sports obviously not the highest priority, even extremely popular games like baseball had to end their season prematurely. Soccer was no different, with entire teams unable to participate in league and cup competitions after losing so many players. Even successful teams like the Fall River Rovers did not enter into any national competitions in the 1918-19 season.

However, with the end of WWI in sight, a certain class of companies benefitted from wartime government investment. Todd Shipyards was chief amongst these, producing many ships for the U.S. navy during its sea campaign against Germany. By 1918, the company had enough money and will to expand its sporting enterprises. William H. Todd, its chief executive, ran a company that was consistently engaged in its community. From a primary location in Erie Basin and Red Hook (then just part of South Brooklyn), he helped multiple sporting and community events flourish. The company sponsored events like ship launchings, dances, and Red Cross drives where employee musical groups would play for the occasion. Baseball, basketball, track and swim meets were all also sponsored by Todd Shipyards, with many of these sports having "work" teams representing a branch of the company - Robins Dry Dock and Repair Company (Erie Basin), Tebo Yacht Basin (at 3rd ave and 23rd street in Brooklyn), and Tietjen & Lang (Hoboken, NJ) all had teams that participated in these sporting endeavors. Frequently, these teams would play in a "Shipyards League" with other companies in the industry, like Morse Dry Dock.

1918 was a more egalitarian sporting landscape than our current one. College Football was the clear front-runner, but outside of that, in an era before TV, many sports were popular. It was not uncommon to see large crowds gathered at track meets, swim meets, bowling, and boxing matches. Soccer was a big part of this sporting landscape. At the time, it was primarily composed of regional associations like the Southern New York State Footballing Association which held their own league championships and cups, and two major national cup competitions - the American Cup and the National Challenge Cup (now the U.S. Open Cup). Baseball was going through a spurt of popularity (primarily caused by Babe Ruth's rise) and was seen as the major summer sport. 

Due to other sports' popularity and despite the frequent delays and poor playing conditions this would cause, soccer would vye to be the national winter sport. The main national cup competitions were run by two different governing bodies - the A.F.A (American Football Association) ran the American Cup and the U.S.F.A. (United States Football Association, recognized by FIFA) ran the National Challenge Cup - a reflection of the consistently fractured state of the sports' governance in the early 20th century. Besides the governing difficulties and the challenge of playing an outdoor sport in the winter, U.S. soccer also struggled with fan and player violence and poor refereeing quality. 

Even with all this, the sport was still clearly growing in popularity and attracting large crowds.

It was into this environment Todd Shipyards would expand its sporting enterprise, creating soccer teams for each of its three major locations on the East coast. Robins Dry Dock F.C. was at the center of this new operation and the most well funded. Right before their first season, in the summer of 1918, Todd Field was built at the corners of Columbia, Lorraine, Bush, and Ostego streets to host outdoor sporting events, including new soccer games.

As a "works" team, all of the Robins players were also employees. This was a sporting era when it was expected for even a successful athlete to have another job. It did not go unnoticed by players and other clubs that shipyard teams were flush with money. Soon they were being accused of luring players with "soft" jobs and high wages. There were rumors that players were given $21 (around $450 in 2026 USD) a day to do little but play soccer. This type of poaching was so pervasive that the U.S.F.A led an official inquiry into the transfer of players to Robins Dry Dock. This was only in their first season.

Robins attracting the best players continued well beyond the first season though. Soon they would amass a talented team that took the U.S. soccer world by storm.


# Early Signs of Success

The earliest Robins game dates back to October of 1918. A Shipbuilding Soccer League was formed with the same industry teams who played baseball against each other that summer. Their first game, and victory, seemed to have been against Morse Dry Dock, a rival in baseball as well. 

The team also participated in the larger competitions of the day - The National Association Football League (NAFL, the highest level league for teams located in the Mid-Atlantic), the Southern New York State Association Leage and Cup, the A.F.A. American Cup, and the most prestigious National Challenge Cup. The war still loomed large over this early part of the season and the Southern New York State Football Association also arranged a cup competition to aid the United War Work Campaign, a massive one-week fundraising effort for the U.S. military. The Robins did not win any of these, but they progressed far enough to show promise.

In the quarter-final of the Southern NY State Cup, they lost to their industry rivals Morse Dry Dock. After the first game was stopped early because of rain and darkness, the Robins lost in the third round of the National Challenge Cup to eventual finalists, Paterson F.C. They finished a middling fourth out of six in the NAFL. 

It was in the American Cup where they progressed the furthest, making it all the way to the semi-final against juggernauts Bethlehem Steel - arguably the most famous team of their day. They lost a fiercely contested battle 3-2, despite being up 1-0 at half-time. Bethlehem would win the double that season, coming out top against Paterson F.C. in both the American Cup final and National Challenge Cup competitions. However, they did not come out of their game with Robins unscathed. Many of their best players would join the shipbuilding team in the next season.


# New Signings and First Trophies

Harry Ratican, one of the most famous players of his era (and a future U.S. soccer hall-of-famer and former Bethlehem Steel player), signed for Robins Dry Dock in November 1919. He was joined by Bobby Millar (also a hall-of-famer and former Beth) and Neil Clarke - two Scottish born players referred to by some as the "Siamese Twins" of U.S. soccer, because of how frequently they played together on the same team. Indeed, they had won the first ever National Challenge Cup together with Brooklyn Field Cup six years earlier. The Robins bolstered their goalkeeping position with the signing of a young Pete Renzulli, also a future hall-of-famer. Clearly, they were a different team for the 1919-20 season.

In the very first round of the National Challenge Cup, they defeated Morse Dry Dock, with Ratican netting two goals. In the next round, they faced another shipyard team - the Federal Shipyards of New Jersey. The game was stopped with two minutes to play, after a free-for-all fight erupted between the players. Violent interruptions were not uncommon in U.S. soccer but this one was extreme. One of the Federal players, their captain David Muir, ended up hitting the referee. He was suspended indefinitely from all soccer playing and the game's score at the time stood, with the Robins winning 3-2. Their next game in the cup would be between their fellow Todd Shipyard compatriots, Tebo Yacht Basin, which they would win 3-1. The Fall River Rovers, who were unable to put together a team because of the Great War last season, were their next opponents. The Rovers were a highly successful New England team, but were downed 4-0 before a record crowd at Todd Field. 

The next game, the Robins well and truly arrived as contenders, beating the famous Bethlehem Steel team, who knocked them out last year, with some of their best players now playing for the Robins. In the semi-final, they would eventually lose to Quincy, MA based Fore River Rovers.

Once again, it was the American Cup where the Dockers found success. Cruising through the first three rounds, Robins initially lost to Morse Dry Dock, their consistent industrial rivals, in the fourth round. However, Morse had fielded an ilegible player, and in the forced replay of the game, the Robins triumphed 2-1. In April 1920, the Robins played the Fore River Rovers again, who had beaten them earlier in the National Challenge Cup. This time, the Robins beat their Quincy rivals 2-0, buying their ticket to the final against another repeat challenger - Bethlehem Steel. In front of a crowd of 7,000 people, the Robins cemented their superiority and beat Bethlehem again 1-0, securing their first major tropy in the process. Renzulli put in a masterclass, saving all of the opposition shots, and helping his team keep a clean sheet.

The intra-company rivalry between Robins and Tebo would continue later in the season. Yet again defeating Morse Dry Dock in the semi-final, the Robins faced-off against Tebo Yacht Basin in the final of the Southern NY State Cup Final. After a scoreless first half, the Robins triumphed again, winning the local cup 3 to 1.

In between all these cup runs, the team took a tour of St. Louis, playing exhibition games against many of its best teams. Harry Ratican, their star striker was originally from the city, and his homecoming was well received. 

St. Louis had its own unique, strong culture of soccer, the game having been brought over by Irish immigrants in the 19th century. It continued to be propogated by the Catholic Church and its associated institutions, who were interested in promoting physical activity in youth. Relatively isolated from the rest of the U.S. soccer playing world, the city would continuously try to "Americanize" the game with their own rules - like 30 minute halves and substitutions (in an era when FIFA outlawed them). They would also be the source of many natural born American players and a style of physical, fast play that contrasted with the short passing game that dominated the east coast. 

Although all friendly matches, this first foray against St. Louis teams would foreshadow Robins' rivalry with Scullin Steel, the famous works team from the city, and the rising tension between "Americanizing" the game and the immigrants who loved and popularized the sport.


# The Double Winning Season

The 1920-1921 season was the historical peak of the Robins soccer team. It was also the last season they would have as a separate entity. That year, they lost Bobby Millar, but added exciting attackers Hosie and Sweeny, to combine with the famed Harry Ratican.

In the American Cup, they met their intra-compay rivals, Tebo Yacht Basin, early and defeated them 2-1. Soon after they began their four round semi-final marathon with Erie A.A. The third replay game ended 4-4, with four penalty kicks awarded. The battles lasted so long that before the fourth game, the Philadelphia Inquirer were accusing the two teams of agreeing to draw to continue to play cup games and rake in gate receipts (there was no actual evidence of this). The games continued to draw large crowds, many thousands showing up to see the two teams slug it out for a place in the final. The A.F.A. decided that the fourth game would be the last, no matter how many extra periods would have to be played. The Robins would not need any, and 5,000 fans showed up to watch them outplay Erie A.A. 4-1, behind a hat-trick from Georgie McKelvey.

Before a crowd of 7,000 in Harrison, NJ, Robins retained their American Cup crown, beating Fore River Rovers 5-2. Initially going down a goal, the team fought back immediately with three goals before the end of the first half. Two goals right after the break secured a dominant victory.

In an early round of the National Challenge Cup, the Robins played against Erie A.A. This round was no less contentious then their play against each other in the American Cup. A crowd of 9,000 saw the first game a 1-1 draw in Harrison. In the next game, the Robins won at Todd Field 5-3. Even before the game started, Erie A.A. protested that the Todd Field pitch was not regulation size. After that protest was thrown out, the team from Kearny, NJ lodged a complaint with the National Challenge Cup Commitee that fans had encroached onto the field during the game and interfered with play. Robins was fined $100 for not having a larger police presence to control the large crowd, but no replay was scheduled and Erie A.A. was officially knocked out.

In a stranger, and more personal turn, Bobby Millar, no longer with the team, was reported to have punched Neil Clarke during half-time of the second game with Erie A.A. Bobby Millar had a history of violent outbursts and had once stopped playing a game to get into a fight with a heckling fan in the stands. However, he did not play for either of the teams at the time and it is unknown why he struck his long-time partner and former team-mate. He was supsended for two months.

In the quarter-finals, the Robins played Fore River Rovers (their future competitors in the final for the American Cup) in Quincy, MA before the "largest crowd that ever attended a soccer game in this part of the State". They convincingly beat them to set up a semin-final match with Tebo Yacht Basin.

The Tebos had made a name for themselves this season as "the clever Tebo Boys", playing 22 games at this point in the season and only losing once, to the Robins in that early round of the American Cup. They had won the local Metropolitan League last year and just won the New York State League this year. They were formidable opponents, but in front of a crowd of 7,000 in Harrison, NJ, they fell to the Robins 3-0. The game was scoreless until the last 15 minutes when the Robins finally broke through. Soon after that goal, an injury to the Tebos centre-half Fryer took him out of the game for five minutes, and the Robins capitalized, scoring two more goals to secure victory.

Their final game in the cup would be played against Scullin Steel from St. Louis, in the neutral city of Fore River. The referee would be James E. Scholefield, who only a few months later would take over as secretary for the U.S.F.A. A few months after that, he would call in sick to a meeting and disappear with around $1,200 in the federation's money. He was found two and a half years later by his wife Ruth, living in Greensboro, North Carolina with a new wife and working for the Salvation Army and Red Cross. He claimed to have gotten into "fast company", entered a fugue state, and came to stranded in Rhode Island with no money. He worked his way down South. He was sentenced to ten years in jail for bigamy.

Before all that, he had to referee a game which was already becoming a referendum on the American style vs the immigrant style of playing the game.
