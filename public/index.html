                <p>By the end of the 1920/21 season, Robins Dry Dock F.C. had spent an embittered fourteen hours sharing the field with their rivals Erie A.A. - from nearby soccer hotbed Kearny, NJ. Four of those games comprised a round of the American Cup, and according to newspapers of that era, was the longest soccer cup round played in the history of the United States. Two of those games were in the more prestigious National Challenge Cup (now known as the U.S. Open Cup). They prevailed in both on their way to a domestic cup double, the first team from Brooklyn to accomplish this feat - a marker of dominance recognized across the diverse, often embattled, world of early soccer in the United States.</p>
<p>A season later they ceased to exist.</p>
<p>Robins Dry Dock F.C. was a &ldquo;works&rdquo; team, founded and funded by the ship building and repair company Todd Shipyards, and its players were all employees of the company. Just a couple of decades earlier, in the north of England, another &ldquo;works&rdquo; team originating from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway company, was struggling to raise funds. Unlike Robins, this team managed to get through its troubles and scrape by with the aid of a few local businessmen. Shortly after the influx of new investment, it changed its name from Newton Heath LYR Football Club to the more recognizable Manchester United.</p>
<p>Where did it go right and where did it go wrong for Robins? There&rsquo;s no easy answer to the rise and fall of a great team, or really the rise and fall of all of soccer in the U.S.A. during those early, optimistic years, when it seemed like the sport was constantly on the precipice of breaking through. Soccer was experiencing those familiar tensions in this country - between an influx in immigration and American isolationism, between win-now greed and grassroots investment, between the urge to go national and the real cultural and practical difficulties in travel across such a big country. Somewhere in the midst of all of that, a team in Red Hook gave a few great years to those early supporters of the sport.</p>
<h1 id="hyphenated-americans">Hyphenated-Americans</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated Americans, I do not refer to naturalized Americans. Some of the very best Americans I have ever known were naturalized Americans, Americans born abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all. This is just as true of the man who puts “native” before the hyphen as of the man who puts German or Irish or English or French before the hyphen. Americanism is a matter of the spirit and of the soul. Our allegiance must be purely to the United States. We must unsparingly condemn any man who holds any other allegiance. But if he is heartily and singly loyal to this Republic, then no matter where he was born, he is just as good an American as anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Theodore Roosevelt | October 12, 1915</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the early 20th century in the northeastern United States, and industry is taking over. Textile mills, shipbuilding yards, factories all spring up and take root in towns and cities. They bring jobs and with those jobs, immigrants looking for jobs.</p>
<p>John R. Drysdale is one of those immigrants, arriving from Scotland in 1899 and quickly settling in and marrying Maud, born in New Jersey to her own set of Scottish immigrant parents. They move together to Brooklyn, John having got a job as a coppersmith at the dry dock (a type of basin that can be flooded to allow vessels in, and then dried to allow them to be worked on) in South Brooklyn, at the end of Ostego street. Years later, he would become a coach of this company&rsquo;s soccer team.</p>
<p>John, along with countless other immigrants, would bring their love of soccer with them.</p>
<p>Scottish-Americans had been coming over in droves to the northeast and they did not just bring their affinity for the game, but also their style. Soccer, having formed as the brother of rugby from an older ball-playing sport, did not have passing embedded into it from the outset. In the mid 1800&rsquo;s, it would not be uncommon for a player to just dribble the ball, with little to no regard to their teammates, and then shoot. Then the other team would do the same. It took a revolution in style in Scotland, in particular from Queen&rsquo;s Park in Glasgow, to bring passing combinations to the fore and change how the game was played. That short passing style quickly became the obvious path forward, and in the U.S., became the style most associated with how &ldquo;hyphenated-Americans&rdquo; played the sport.</p>
<p>In the first part of the twentieth century many of these &ldquo;hyphenated-Americans&rdquo; settled in what would become early hotbeds of soccer activity of the Northeast. The textile mill hubs of Fall River, MA and Kearny, NJ attracted new workers. New York City, of course, had always been a center for immigration.</p>
<p>When Robins Dry Dock FC formed in 1918, the world of NYC soccer was already full of teams representing the country or ethnic homeland they had emigrated from. For six years running (and many years after), the New York Footballers&rsquo; Protective Association (an organization that helped provide funds for injured players) held a popular fundraising tournament where players would join teams of their nationality (like Sweden, Scotland, England) and play against each other. In the local leagues, team names like Hungarian-American FC or Clan MacDuff were not uncommon.</p>
<p>In an early round of the National Challenge Cup in 1918, Robins played the New York Students&rsquo; Chinese Soccer Club, billed as the first Chinese-American soccer team in the U.S. Founded by Kwang Lim Kwong, a student at Columbia University, the team was good enough to compete in the major competitions of the day, although they lost to Robins Dry Dock 6 - 0, and mentions of them in the 1920s faded.</p>
<p>The Robins themselves would be frequently referred to as a team of immigrants, with most of their players being of English or Scottish descent. Their manager - John R. Drysdale - was no different.</p>
<p>Their time together would be bookended by Theodore Roosevelt&rsquo;s Hyphenated-Americans speech and the 1924 Immigration Act, which imposed quotas on immigrants from certain countries. Wider, negative trends towards immigrants would be reflected in the discourse about what soccer should be and who it should be played by, with the Robins central to that conversation.</p>
<h1 id="a-war-work-team">A War Work Team</h1>
<p>In 1918, the Great War was coming to a close. The U.S.&rsquo;s involvement had caused many thousands of sportsmen to be drafted or enlist. With sports obviously not the highest priority, even extremely popular games like baseball had to end their season prematurely. Soccer was no different, with entire teams unable to participate in league and cup competitions after losing so many players.</p>
<p>However, with the end of WWI in sight, a certain class of companies benefitted from wartime government investment. Todd Shipyards was chief amongst these, producing many ships for the U.S. navy during its sea campaign against Germany. By 1918, the company had enough money and will to expand its sporting enterprises. William H. Todd, its chief executive, ran a company that was consistently engaged in its community. From a primary location in Erie Basin and Red Hook, he helped multiple sporting and community events flourish. The company sponsored events like ship launchings, dances, and Red Cross drives where employee musical groups would play for the occasion. Baseball, basketball, track and swim meets were all also sponsored by Todd Shipyards, with many of these sports having &ldquo;work&rdquo; teams representing a branch of the company - Robins Dry Dock and Repair Company (Erie Basin), Tebo Yacht Basin (at 3rd ave and 23rd street in Brooklyn), and Tietjen &amp; Lang (Hoboken, NJ) all had teams that participated in these sporting endeavors. Frequently, these teams would play in a &ldquo;Shipyards League&rdquo; with other companies in the industry, like Morse Dry Dock.</p>
<p>1918 was a more egalitarian sporting landscape than our current one. College Football was the clear front-runner, but outside of that, in an era before TV, many sports were popular. It was not uncommon to see large crowds gathered at track meets, swim meets, bowling, and boxing matches. Soccer was a big part of this sporting landscape. At the time, it was primarily composed of regional associations like the Southern New York State Footballing Association which held their own league championships and cups, and two major national cup competitions - the American Cup and the National Challenge Cup (now the U.S. Open Cup). Baseball was going through a spurt of popularity (primarily caused by Babe Ruth&rsquo;s rise) and was seen as the major summer sport. Due to other sports&rsquo; popularity and despite the frequent delays and poor playing conditions this would cause, soccer would vye to be the national winter sport.</p>
<p>It was into this environment Todd Shipyards would expand its sporting enterprise, creating soccer teams for each of its three major locations on the East coast. Robins Dry Dock F.C. was at the center of this new operation and the most well funded. Right before their first season, in the summer of 1918, Todd Field was built at the corners of Columbia, Lorraine, Bush, and Ostego streets to host outdoor sporting events, including new soccer games.</p>
<p>As a &ldquo;works&rdquo; team, all of the Robins players were also employees. This was a sporting era when proffesionalization was scarce. It was expected for even a successful athlete to have another job. It did not go unnoticed by players and other clubs that shipyard teams were flush with money. Soon they were being accused of luring players with &ldquo;soft&rdquo; jobs and high wages - players were given $21 (around $450 in 2026 USD) a day to do little but play soccer. This type of poaching was common enough that the U.S.F.A (the national soccer governing body) led an official inquiry into the movement of players to Robins Dry Dock. This was only in their first season.</p>
<p>Robins would not be confined to luring the best players around in their first year. Soon they would amass a talented team that took the soccer world by storm.</p>
